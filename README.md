### Turtles
I've tried to make this project as simpler as possible. 
Here I've have imported turtle for the obvious reasons and random for the Turtle race which decides who will win the race.
This is based on a Turtle which we use to make the verticle lines on which they run horizontally with the help of first **for** loop. 
This is done totally on the basis of **penup() and pendown()** function. Here we name Five Turtles and define thier color and starting point. Then in second loop we rotate the turtles one by one. Simple **for loop** is again used for the 3rd time to move the turtles forward with the use of random spaces here.
