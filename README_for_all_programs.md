### Turtles
I've tried to make this project as simple as possible. 
Here I've have imported turtle for the obvious reasons and random for the Turtle race which decides who will win the race.
This is based on a Turtle which we use to make the verticle lines on which they run horizontally with the help of first **for** loop. 
This is done totally on the basis of **penup() and pendown()** function. Here we name Five Turtles and define thier color and starting point. Then in second loop we rotate the turtles one by one. Simple **for loop** is again used for the 3rd time to move the turtles forward with the use of random spaces here.

### Spaceitis_ISS
This is an awesome small code for showing the live information of astronauts in ISS(International space station | NASA). Ofcourse you'll need net connection to run this code successfully.
You can cross verify the live location of astronauts [here](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com//). Also this program shows the live location of ISS i.e its latitude and longitude and number of people in space with their names. It is done with the help of **JSON library** which helps to transmit and receive data between a server and web application in JSON format. The basic idea is to load data from the URL and just printing it. For names, again **for() loop** is used and Latitude and Longitude were printed directly.
